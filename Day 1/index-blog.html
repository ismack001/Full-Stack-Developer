        <h1>My First Blog Post – The Journey Begins (with Train Travel Tips!)</h1>

        <p>Hello, and welcome to my little corner of the world—online, that is! </p>

        <p>I’m Istakhar, and this is the very first post of what I hope will become a journal of adventures,
            discoveries, and stories from the road. After years of dreaming, planning, and collecting passport stamps,
            I’ve finally decided to start this travel blog.</p>

        <p>Travel has always been more than just a hobby for me—it's a way of life. Whether it's wandering through
            ancient cities, finding hidden cafés in quiet neighborhoods, getting lost in local markets, or simply
            watching the sunset in a place I've never been, I find magic in the unknown. Every trip teaches me something
            new—not just about the world, but about myself.</p>

        <h1>Second Blog : The Beauty of Mountain Scenery – Nature at Its Best 🏔️✨</h1>
        <p>There’s something truly magical about standing in front of a mountain view—the kind that makes you pause, breathe deeply, and just feel. Whether you’re hiking to the top or simply admiring from below, mountains have a way of reminding us how beautiful and powerful nature really is.</p>
       

        <img src="https://wallpapers.com/images/featured/mountain-scenery-0jvee03idq7nhmrc.jpg" width="600px">
    <p>Here are a few things I love most about mountain scenery:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>🏞️Breathtaking Views</li>
        <li>🌄Sunrise and Sunset Moments</li>
        <li>📸Perfect for Photography</li>
    </ul>



    <p>
        Mountains remind us to slow down and appreciate the simple beauty around us. You don’t need to climb the highest peak—sometimes just sitting quietly and looking up is enough.
